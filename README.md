## PIC18F4550 Temperature Control Simulation (on development)

This project simulates a PIC18F4550 temperature control system using Proteus and MPLAB X. The system controls a motor based on the temperature, which can be set manually or automatically.

### Hardware

* PIC18F4550 microcontroller (simulated in Proteus)
* LM35 Temperature sensor (simulated in Proteus)
* Motor DC (simulated in Proteus)
* More...

### Software

* Microchip XC8 Compiler
* Microchip MPLAB X IDE
* Proteus

### Simulation Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open on MPLAB X IDE.
3. Click the "Build" button to compile and assemble the project.
4. Open the project in Proteus.
...

### Usage

1. Set the desired temperature using the simulated LM35 in Proteus.
2. If the temperature is above the set limit, the motor will turn on (simulated in Proteus).
